# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy with Pinecone!

### Pre-deployment Status:

- ‚úÖ Database connection configured (PostgreSQL)
- ‚úÖ Redis connection configured (with fallback)
- ‚úÖ Pinecone vector store implemented
- ‚úÖ Auto-detection of vector store (Pinecone > Redis fallback)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables set in Railway
- ‚úÖ Error handling improved
- ‚úÖ All dependencies in requirements.txt

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Get Pinecone API Key:**

   - Sign up at https://pinecone.io
   - Create a new project
   - Copy your API key

2. **Set Environment Variables in Railway:**

   - `PINECONE_API_KEY` = your_pinecone_api_key
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your_openai_api_key

3. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Pinecone vector search for production"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Monitor logs for:**
   - Pinecone initialization
   - Vector store selection
   - Performance metrics

### Expected Performance:

- **With Pinecone**: ‚ö° Fast vector search (milliseconds)
- **Without Pinecone**: üêå Redis fallback (slower but functional)

### Environment Variables Required:

- `PINECONE_API_KEY` (for production vector search)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for embeddings)
- `DATABASE_URL` (auto-configured by Railway)
- `REDIS_URL` (auto-configured by Railway)
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (set in railway.toml)

### Pinecone Free Tier Limits:

- 1M vectors
- 10GB storage
- Perfect for MVP and testing

Your app is production-ready with world-class vector search! üöÄ
