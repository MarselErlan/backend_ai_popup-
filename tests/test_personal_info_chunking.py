WORK AUTHORIZATION
I am authorized to work in the United States. I am a U.S. citizen and do not require visa sponsorship for employment.

SALARY EXPECTATIONS
My salary expectations are in the range of $120,000 - $150,000 annually, depending on the role, benefits, and company location. I am open to negotiation based on the total compensation package.

WORK PREFERENCES
I prefer hybrid work arrangements with 2-3 days in office and 2-3 days remote. I am available for full-time positions and can start within 2-4 weeks notice. I am willing to relocate for the right opportunity.

TECHNICAL PREFERENCES
I enjoy working with Python, JavaScript, and modern web technologies. I have experience with both frontend and backend development, but I'm particularly passionate about test automation and quality engineering.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
I have a strong background in both manual and automated testing. I've worked across various industries including healthcare, fintech, and e-commerce. I'm passionate about building robust testing frameworks and improving software quality.

I'm also interested in mentoring junior developers and contributing to open-source projects. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading tech blogs, and experimenting with new programming languages and frameworks.

AVAILABILITY
I am available for interviews Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 6 PM PST. I can also accommodate weekend calls if needed. My preferred interview format is video call, but I'm flexible with in-person meetings in the San Francisco Bay Area.

REFERENCES
References are available upon request. I can provide contacts from my previous employers and colleagues who can speak to my technical skills and work ethic."""

I am authorized to work in the United States without restriction. I am a U.S. citizen by birth and do not require any form of visa sponsorship, including H1-B, L1, or any other work visa.

VISA HISTORY
I have never held a work visa as I have been a U.S. citizen since birth. I have a valid U.S. passport and Social Security number.

FUTURE SPONSORSHIP
I will not require visa sponsorship now or in the future for employment in the United States. I can provide Form I-9 documentation immediately upon hire.

INTERNATIONAL WORK
I am open to international assignments and have a valid passport for travel. I would require appropriate work visas for employment outside the United States, which I understand would be handled by the employer."""
